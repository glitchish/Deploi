### Deploi

My page containing notes and stuff about my github life.

`>>` I decided that if my github.io or is-a.dev site doesn't work, I don't care. Because it's way too much work to fix, and at this point, it's also too confusing to be honest. So I am just gonna work on other things, maybe my readme, and ignore my site... probably archive it.

`>>` I did a mass username change for a *lot* of stuff, bugs will be found, and because of that, I've made the conscious decision to *never* again change my username for Replit
or Github.
